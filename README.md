# My first webpage

#### This is the first webpage I have ever written. I will link you to the epicodus website and to another webpage of mine. Also there is a picture of a cute cat.

#### BY Sean Gorman and Jin Camou

##  This webpage gives you a glimpse into my best attempt at making a webpage for the first time. I included a link to epicodus.com, the website of the programming school I attend. I list a few subjects I will be learning thru this course and finish off with a nice cat picture.
